So this project was a little more difficult than the Sinatra project, but I still had fun building it.  Using Devise and Omniauth was a little confusing at first, but after it's all said and done, Devise is awesome!  It saves so much time creating your log in and sign up! It took me a little while to figure out my associations, but after I did, I was off to the races.  First, I got all my controllers and models set up.  Then I figured out which routes I was going to have nested.  Having all my routes set up, I 
then went into my controllers and started setting up all my actions.  It took me a while to figure out the actions with nested routes, but eventually I figured it out.  I created all my forms and used my partials.  I also added some helper methods to keep my code dry.  I've realized that doing these projects really helps me understand the code a lot more.  Going through 
the curriculum I get a grasp on things.  But with the labs, a lot of it is in there for us already.  And I think that doing these projects and starting from scratch makes me really understand what's going on.  This was true for Sinatra and extremely true for rails.  So now that my rails project is done, bring it on JavaScript!
